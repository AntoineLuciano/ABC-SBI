TO DO (HIGH LEVEL)
- Code review (Ryan ASAP) -> Correctness and what could make experiments easier to run??
- Consistency condition (Lipschitz condition on the posterior/loss) 
- Experiments!!!



TO DO ANTOINE :
- ðŸ”„ Finish the interactive CLI (src/abcnre/utils/interactive.py) -> MOSTLY DONE, needs debugging for pipe inputs
- Fix the virtual env!!! (requirements_antoine.txt)
- Run tests with all the NNConfig possible
- Speed up SBC 
- Improve the Diagnostic section
- Think of an experiment structure (same number of simulations different epsilons)
- Summary Leaner -> Regressor in all the code 
 

NEW IDEAS
- Think to the non-binary kernel? 

GOALS: 
- Presentation at Greek Stochastics (end of Aug) Which experiment? 
        - Run with MCMC? 
        - Efficiency vs NRE in terms of speed and simulations? 
        - Show that we indeed break the dimension curse?
- ArXiv paper (when we are happy)
- Submit to Bayesian Analysis (by end of Spring 26)???


RYAN'S CODE NOTES:
- Let's use virtual envioronments with a requirements file.  This requires agreeing on a Jupyter kernel name.  I used ABC-SBI-kernel
